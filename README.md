Routing of two pages is implemented on the site: Home and Beers.
On the main page after clicking the [Beers] link the user is redirected to the Beers page.
The Beers page displays cards of different types of beer. When you click on the card with the left mouse button, a modal window opens in which complete information about the type of beer is displayed. The modal window can be closed by left-clicking on [Backdrop] or by pressing [Esc] on the keyboard.
By right-clicking on a card its frame turns red and the [Delete] button appears in the upper right corner of the page. By clicking the [Delete] button with the left mouse button the selected cards are removed from the viewing list.
The lazy scroll function has been implemented. When scrolling to the end of the page the display of cards changes - the first 5 cards are removed and 5 cards are added to the end of the list.
The project is deployed on Netlify pages.
